History of Acting is a site that hopes to educate people interested in acting - teachers and
students. The site informs about the lesser known theatre practitioners. Most actors are
familiar with the teachings of Brook and Stanislavski. This site educates about the
thoughts of Meyerhold, Grotowski and Brecht on the craft. There is an option on the
website to book Dublin based classes relating to each of the practitioners. There are also
links to useful YouTube videos on the site.
