function stan(){document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=`Let's imagine I have to fulfil a task on stage in the theatre. Then there is something strange because my close friend is in the theatre. Why should someone
come to see me in the theatre and why am I on stage? This prevents me from
believing in the task I have been given. I have to explain away all these
inconsistencies. To do this the student has to imagine in detail all the attendant
circumstances, he has to imagine the precise history of the given circumstances.
This imaginary explanation can be very naive, simple or even stupid and in itself
may not be able to be justified but that does not matter. Our imaginary explanation
must help us justify the inconsistencies in a given task and, once we have filled in
the blanks, make us believe that all the contradictory facts are possible.
I can justify the given task, for example, this way. I have come to the theatre
with my sick friend because my landlord has managed to throw me out of my
apartment for his own reasons and because I cannot find a new apartment for the
moment and so I have been obliged to ask the director of the theatre to allow me
to stay there for the time being, etc.
I am on stage because the manager has ordered all the floors in the theatre to
be polished and has sent me on stage while it is being done, etc.
My visitor has come first because I have to be here for a while and second
because he is leaving Moscow today, etc.`;}
