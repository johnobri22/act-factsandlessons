function stan(){document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML= `Let's imagine I have to fulfil a task on stage in the theatre. Then there is something strange because my close friend is in the theatre. Why should someone
come to see me in the theatre and why am I on stage? This prevents me from
believing in the task I have been given. I have to explain away all these
inconsistencies. To do this the student has to imagine in detail all the attendant
circumstances, he has to imagine the precise history of the given circumstances.
This imaginary explanation can be very naive, simple or even stupid and in itself
may not be able to be justified but that does not matter. Our imaginary explanation
must help us justify the inconsistencies in a given task and, once we have filled in
the blanks, make us believe that all the contradictory facts are possible.
I can justify the given task, for example, this way. I have come to the theatre
with my sick friend because my landlord has managed to throw me out of my
apartment for his own reasons and because I cannot find a new apartment for the
moment and so I have been obliged to ask the director of the theatre to allow me
to stay there for the time being, etc.
I am on stage because the manager has ordered all the floors in the theatre to
be polished and has sent me on stage while it is being done, etc.
My visitor has come first because I have to be here for a while and second
because he is leaving Moscow today, etc.`;}

Jouvet makes a crucial distinction between the personality actor, the acteur, and the actor who transforms himself into someone else, the comedien. The comédien must examine, test out his subjective feelings in relation to the text, with all its demands, its historical factors, so that what he offers becomes 'objective'. 

Rousseau: 'The character is not the individual that we are but the individual we wish to persuade others that we are'

It is the tensions between self and character, the awareness of playing a fiction that brings a role to life

A man can fulfil a variety of roles and functions as he goes through life: son, brother, nephew, father, husband, lover, bank manager, gambler 

Sometimes there is a conflict between certain aspects of the same life. A man can be an army officer and a Catholic with a conflict between the two. At the centre of any given person, consciously or not, whether he knows it or not, there is a secret.

There is no theme in a play, there is an action and it is for the audience to interpret that action, to see in it whatever it wants.`;}

function real(){document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML=`The actor must make it his own to such an extent that the thoughts and efforts of his character become his own and are constantly in his mind throughout the performance  

Realism depicts characters and settings as they would actually have existed, while naturalism concentrates on the biological, social and economic aspects

Shchepkin:
An actor must be able to feel and sympathise with all sorts and classes and behave in ways appropriate to different social groups. • In comedy, an actor should not consciously attempt to be funny, comedy and tragedy both arise from truthful behaviour.   

These principles represent the first genuine, modern statement on acting; there are no references to rhetoric, declamation or rules of gesture

One actor does not cry on stage but by giving, so to speak, a semblance of tears, makes the audience cry.`;}
